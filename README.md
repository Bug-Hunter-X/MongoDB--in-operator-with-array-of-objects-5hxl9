# MongoDB $in operator with array of objects
This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB when querying with an array of objects.  The `$in` operator works correctly only when used with an array of scalar values. Using it with an array of objects won't produce the intended results.
The solution shows how to correctly query using the `$or` operator instead for this scenario.
